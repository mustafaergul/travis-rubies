# Travis Rubies

my rubies, let me show you them

In order to build a new ruby release, write the ruby version into `build_info.sh`,
e.g. `ruby-2.3.1`, and push.

Travis will then build the release, which you can watch here:
https://travis-ci.com/travis-ci/travis-rubies

Once the build completes, the new version should show up here:
http://rubies.travis-ci.org/

## web

You are looking at the `build` branch. The actual web app can be found on the [master](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-rubies/tree/master) branch.
